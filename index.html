                With increasing resistance of microorganisms to antifungal and antimicrobial agents, it is becoming relevantly important to discover alternatives that would also be effective in inhibiting pathogenic microorganisms.
            </li>
            <li>
                Due to increasing resistance of bacteria and fungi, there may be a severe shortage of effective drugs in the future, that is why this study of essential oils as alternative medicine, is important.
            </li>
            <li>
                The antifungal and antibacterial activity of essential oils is effectively tested by agar diffusion method, where the essential oils are added to agar in which the pathogenic strain is uniformly infected.

            In this study, 10 samples were collected from dog's external ears. Two of sampled dogs had showed clinical symptoms and were confirmed to have <span>otitis externa</span>, while others were healthy. In all of the samples <span>M. Pachydermatis</span> was present, although the concentration of the pathogen was extremelly different comparing heatlhy and ill dogs. <br>

            After collection of the samples, cytology test was performed. After the confirmation of <span>Malassezia spp.,</span> presence, the pathogen is added to a Sabouraud Dextrose Agar(SDA) and is being cultivated for 72-96 hours at 30C temperature. No lipids were added and as know, the only species of <span>Malassezia spp.,</span> being independant of lipids is <span>Pachydermatis</span>. 
            Essential oils were dilluted with sterile water to 1%, 0,5% and 0,25% using Ultrasonic bath to spread the oil equally. Essential oils that were used in this study - <span>Melaleuca alternifolia, Thymus vulgaris, Rosmarinus officinalis L., Azadirachta indica</span>.
            After testing the essential oils, results were compared to <span>Clotrimazole</span> applying agar diffusion method.
            Since essential oils are volatile, the inhibition zones were not always formed correctly. <br>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Overall, essential oils are efficient in higher concentrations. Lower concentrations, such as 0,5% or 0,25% do not show enough of efficiency to be concidered in performing clinical trials. Altough, higher concentrations may cause skin irritations and <span>dermatitis</span>. 
            </li>
            <li>
                In this study, <span>Melaleuca alternifolia</span> concentration of 1% was found to be the most efficient of the tested essential oils and <span>M. Pachydermatis</span> is absolutely susceptible. Thus, compared to Clotrimazole, inhibition zones were less significant.
            </li>
            <li>
                To conclude, essential oils on low concentrations could be used as alternative medicine treating fungi infections in cases were traditional Western medicine shows no results.
